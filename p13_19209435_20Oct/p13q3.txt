(a) If you include the line print(print_max())?
    
    Ans: It executed print_max function and print "None", because print_max return None. 

(b) If you omit the brackets after print_max(), ie just have print_max? 

    Ans: Nothing happend.


(c) If you include the line print(print_max)?

    Ans: print out <function print_max at 0x7fcce8711950>
    It seems like the memory address of this function.
