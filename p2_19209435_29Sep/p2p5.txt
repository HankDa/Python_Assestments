Experiment with different values of x and y. For example: 

(a) What happens when x and y are the same?  

Ans: There are no any letters are printed, because x means the starting index and y-x means how many index will be sliced.

(b) What happens when x is greater than y? 

Ans: There are no any letters are printed, because x means the starting index and y-x means how many letter will be sliced, so if x greater than y the number of sliced letter will be negative and print nothing.

(c) What happens when x is omitted? 

Ans: x will be 0,  the default value.

(d) What happens when y is omitted? 

Ans: y will be the length of string, the default value.

(e) What happens when both x and y are omitted?

Ans: Both of x and y will be default value.
